# USERS APPLICATION

An application that recieve a collection of objects from an external API and handled using Ruby and Rails.

## Reason:

My main reason why I'm creating this application is because I want accept data from an external API and treat that data the same way Ruby on Rails data from a database using the most popular Ruby gem ActiveRecord. So the application with behave ActiveRecord-ish with external data.

- Model
- Callbacks
- Pagination
